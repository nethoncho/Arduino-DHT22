  DHT22.cpp - DHT22 sensor library
  Developed by Ben Adams - 2011
  Protocol Fix by Jens Geisler - 2014

The same sensor has also been spotted going by the names RHT22, AM2302
and RHT03 from a variety of vendors. It uses a non-standard 1-wire digital
signalling protocol.

To install this library for use with the Arduino IDE, copy it
to the `libraries' folder and restart the IDE. For an example of
how to use it, see File->Examples->DHT22->Serial .

The original library, after sending the sensor read-out initiation signal, waited 20us to 40us on a LOW signal, when it should have been looking for a 20us to 40 us sensor "setup time" HIGH signal. Then the original library expected a 80us HIGH "ACK pulse" when it should have been looking for a 80us LOW "ACK pulse" and a second 80us HIGH "ACK pulse". Thus the original library "saw" an extra pair of low and hi signals which it interpreted as a first invalid data-bit.
Somehow the original worked quite well for me (and apparently for many others aswell) for a long time. Only on sensors connected via very long (>20m) twisted pair cable I sometimes didn't get a sensors to communicate. Interestingly when this happened it happened right at the first read and continued to persist. But after resetting my arduino a couple of times it started to work again and didn't go bad ever after (until - maybe - the next reset). So, I always thought it had something to do with the line being in a bad state at startup.
But then I wanted to read six sensors and was not able to get of them working at the same time, no matter how often I resetted. So, I wrote a sketch to see what is going on on the sensor line and found out that the original library must have misinterpreted the spec.
So, here is a corrected version, in the hope it will prevent others from the frustration I suffered.

Version 0.6: 24-May-2014 by Jens Geisler
Fixed the protocol according to https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Temperature/DHT22.pdf
Added test sketch to analyse the timing of the sensor

Version 0.5: 15-Jan-2012 by Craig Ringer
Update to support Arduino 1.0
Make accessors inlineable so they can be optimised away
Preserve original integer values from sensor and offer access to them
Permit floating point support to be disalbed by defining DHT22_NO_FLOAT before including DHT22.h

Version 0.4: 24-Jan-2011 by Ben Adams
Added return code constants to keywords.txt
Returns DHT_ERROR_CHECKSUM on check sum mismatch 

Version 0.3: 17-Jan-2011 by Ben Adams
This version reads data
Needs check sum code added at the end of readData

Version 0.2: 16-Jan-2011 by Ben Adams
Changed coding style to match other Arduino libraries.
This version will not read data either!

Version 0.1: 10-Jan-2011 by Ben Adams nethoncho AT gmail.com
First Version is a skeleton. This version will not read data!
